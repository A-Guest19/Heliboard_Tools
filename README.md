# Heliboard_Tools
A collection of tools I'll be using alongside Heliboard. I wouldn't recommend downloading all of them unless you have all the same issues.

### File Saver
File saver was made because I had an issue with not being able to use a keyboard from someone else or another device without direct download. So you can put the file in and it forces a direct download. It's fully offline and your file doesn't upload to anywhere. Made with ChatGPT.
